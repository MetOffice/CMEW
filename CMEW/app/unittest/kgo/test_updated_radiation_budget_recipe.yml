  description: This diagnostic analyses the radiation budget by separating top-of-atmosphere
    fluxes into clear-sky and cloud forcing components, and surface fluxes into downwelling
    and upwelling components. Model predictions are compared against three observational
    estimates, one of which (Stephens et al. 2012) includes uncertainty estimates.
    When the black error bars overlap the zero line, the model is consistent with
    observations according to Stephens et al. (2012).
