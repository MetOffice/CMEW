The Climate Model Evaluation Workflow (|CMEW|) is a Cylc 8 workflow that is used
to evaluate climate models for all Earth System Model (|ESM|) components. See the
CMEW documentation for more information.

|Cylc| v8 and |Rose| v2 are used as the workflow engine and application
configuration system for the |CMEW|, respectively.
